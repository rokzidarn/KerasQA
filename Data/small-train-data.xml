  <instance id="0" scenario="changing a light bulb">
    <text>I went into my bedroom and flipped the light switch. Oh, I see that the ceiling lamp is not turning on. It must be that the light bulb needs replacement. I go through my closet and find a new light bulb that will fit this lamp and place it in my pocket. I also get my stepladder and place it under the lamp. I make sure the light switch is in the off position. I climb up the ladder and unscrew the old light bulb. I place the old bulb in my pocket and take out the new one. I then screw in the new bulb. I climb down the stepladder and place it back into the closet. I then throw out the old bulb into the recycling bin. I go back to my bedroom and turn on the light switch. I am happy to see that there is again light in my room.</text>

  <instance id="1" scenario="having a barbecue">
    <text>The weather was so nice today that I decided to have a barbecue. I called up some of my friends to invite them over. I set up some chairs and tables outside for my friends to sit around. I then took out some hot dogs from my fridge and brought them over to my barbecue. My barbecue is a gas barbecue, so all I had to do was press the knob and turn it to ignite it. Once I got a little fire going I put my hot dogs on the grill over it to cook. I closed the lid and left my hot dogs to cook for about ten minutes. After ten minutes I decided to check on them to see if they were done. They looked like they were cooked, so I put them all on a plate to serve to my friends. I went to my kitchen and got hot dog buns, ketchup, mustard, and relish to serve on top of the hot dogs. I laid out all of the food and condiments on the table so my friends could help themselves. We ate the hot dogs and relaxed around the table.</text>

  <instance id="2" scenario="getting the newspaper">
    <text>On Sunday mornings, our paper boy usually has the paper delivered by 7 AM.  He rides his bike through the neighborhood and tosses the papers on everyone's yards before most anyone gets up.  When I wake up on Sunday mornings, I put on my robe and put on my slippers.  I walk down the stairs and go to the door.  I unlock it and go outside to look for my paper.  I walk down the steps and I see it on the lawn, carefully wrapped in plastic, protecting it from the weather.  I grab the paper and pull it out of the plastic as I walk back up the steps and go back into my house.  I throw away the plastic and sit at the table while my coffee brews.  I scan over the paper looking at the different articles, focusing on one in particular about a local political debate.</text>

  <instance id="3" scenario="painting a wall">
    <text>Last time I had to paint a wall was when I bought a new house. Although the house was new to me, it was a fixer upper house. As a result, the house had a lot of quirks and one of which was the painting on the wall. It was not updated and did not look great. As a result, I felt that I needed to redo the paint. in doing so, I decided to get paint that was interesting to me and after purchasing the paint, I completed the paint job by myself. This was a great experience and I enjoyed painting and using primer and such and I felt that I did a great job at completing this task by myself. It was rewarding to be able to do it by myself. Afterward, my room looked great and I enjoyed seeing it look different than before. It was wonderful.</text>

  <instance id="4" scenario="ironing laundry">
    <text>After grabbing the laundry basket and unloading my now dry clothes from the dryer I take all my dress shirts, slacks, and dresses over to the room where we keep the ironing board. I take out a pair of dress slacks and lay them out carefully over the ironing board with the legs laid out flat so they can be pressed with the iron. I turn on the iron to medium heat and take out a can of starch. Starch helps keep the pants from wrinkling, starch is almost like hairspray for clothes, keeps things from moving out of place. From there I push the iron back and forth from the bottom of the pant leg all the way up to the waist until all the wrinkles on the pants have been ironed out. Once finished with one side of the pants, I flip the pants over and iron the other side. When the pants are finished being ironed, they need to be hung up on a coat hanger so they can stay nice and pressed.</text>

  <instance id="5" scenario="walking a dog">
    <text>Jerry walks his family dog every morning, and every night. He knows it is important for his dog to be able to empty his bladder and relieve himself, as well as getting exercise and walking. So, he gets up early before school, puts on his clothes, jacket, and shoes, walks outside and puts the puppy on a leash.  He takes his puppy for a walk to the front yard, and out to the street.  He also carries a bag, for cleaning up after if he needs it.  It takes Jerry about 20 minutes in the morning to let his dog walk around, exercise, and &quot;use the bathroom&quot; , but he takes a longer walk with him in the afternoon after school.  He takes him to the park, to play frisbee, and to see the other dogs in the neighborhood that play at the park.  After he walks with his dog, he feeds his dog, and gives him water to drink.  He then puts him in the back yard, and takes his leash off as usual.</text>
